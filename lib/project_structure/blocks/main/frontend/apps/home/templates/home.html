    <h4>What can I do now ?</h4>

    <p>
        You can modify the home application (which is currently showing here), by editing the code
        in /blocks/main/frontend/apps/home/.
    </p>

    <p>
        You can generate blocks, which are basically modules to keep your different features independent.

    <pre>$ smartblocks generate_block</pre>
    </p>

    <p>
        You can generate types, which creates models, controllers and everything to persist data :

    <pre>$ smartblocks generate_type</pre>
    </p>

    <p>
        You can generate apps, which creates views, templates and stylesheets to create front-end apps.

    <pre>$ smartblocks generate_type</pre>
    </p>
